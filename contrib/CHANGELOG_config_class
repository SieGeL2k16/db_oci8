APPLICATION=oci8_config_class - PHP class provides permanent configuration storage in Oracle.

V0.10 (13-Jan-2009) - The table and procedure names are now configurable by
                      passing other names to the constructor as additional parameters.

      (04-Jan-2009) - Added first test script to check if all methods are working.

                    - Added method "initDBObjects()" which checks for existance
                      of the table OCI8_CFG_CLASS_TABLE and the procedure
                      OCI8_CFG_CLASS_SET_CONFIG(). If either of them can't be
                      found the method auto-creates the missing object.
                      This method is currently called from the constructor, but
                      plan is to add some kind of a define to avoid the call to
                      maximize performance.

                    - Class code now functional.

      (01-Jan-2009) - Initial release. Ported the test functions from one of my
                      Oracle based projects into a class. Currently the code is
                      not adapted to work as class code.
