APPLICATION=db_oci8 - Oracle OCI8 Class for PHP 4/5

V1.05 (04-Jan-2015) - Fixed notice during wrong variable in SaveBLOB()

      (30-Oct-2014) - Returned old showError value in setErrorHandling()

      (07-Jan-2013) - Added Hostname detection via posix_uname() or via
                      env var HOSTNAME - used for cli based scripts

V1.04 (25-Jul-2013) - Next public release as V1.04

      (30-May-2013) - Added new methods "SetAction()", "SetClientInfo()" and
                      "SetClientIdentifier()"

V1.03 (06-Jan-2012) - Added bind var support to SaveBLOB() method.

V1.02 (29-Dec-2011) - Next public release as 1.02

      (08-Dec-2011) - Added missing error handling in case oci_parse() failed. The
                      following methods where enhanced:
                      Query(), QueryResult(), QueryHash(), QueryResultHash()

V1.01 (30-Jun-2011) - Next public release as V1.01

                    - Fixed bug in examples/test_inout_vars.php

      (20-Jun-2011) - Added missing outputVar support code to ExecuteHash()

      (20-May-2011) - PHP5: Execute() and ExecuteHash() have now a second parameter
                      which allows to disable automatic error handling. The obsolete
                      class variable "no_exit" is removed.

                    - PHP5: All oci_* calls are now prepended with the '@' sign to
                      avoid emitting warnings to screen output.

      (22-Oct-2010) - PHP5: Added debug_print_backtrace() output in Print_Error().
                      Output is only shown if the debug level is set to show all errors.

V1.00 (07-Aug-2010) - Next public release as V1.00 .

                    - Added last missing method "SaveBLOB()" to PHP 5 class, updated
                      documentation, added textfile with informations about the
                      differences between the PHP 4 and PHP 5 classes, updated
                      examples to fully working with both class versions. Also
                      updated PHP 4 class to have the missing Get* methods added.

      (15-May-2010) - Ported Query* Methods to PHP5 class.

                    - setPrefetch() call in QueryResult() fixed to actually use
                      the statement handle (both classes).

                    - Commit() / Rollback() now both accept an external connection
                      resource as value, if none is given the internal resource
                      is used (both classes).

      (14-May-2010) - Initial version of PHP5 class. Filename is renamed to
                      "db_oci8.class.php", this way one can use both classes at once.
                      Class object is still the same (db_oci8), but now all OCI
                      calls are using the PHP5 naming scheme. Also new functionality
                      of PHP 5.3.2 like setting the client name/module name is
                      used if available.

V0.78 (20-Apr-2010) - This will be the last PHP 4 compatible release of this class.
                      All future releases will support only PHP5 and the new class
                      model, so it won't work anymore under PHP4.

                    - Added support for a default charset in dbdefs.inc.php with
                      new define "OCIDB_CHARSET".
                      If this define is not set the NLS_LANG value will be used.
                      See README for details. The Connect() method supports
                      this with a new parameter, too.

                    - Added support for session modes in the connect() method.
                      This allows to perform connections as SYSDBA/SYSOPER,
                      but requires the php.ini setting oci8.privileged_connect
                      to be enabled. Also this works only since PHP 5.1.2!

      (26-Jul-2009) - Added checks for the various class defines so that PHP
                      won't complain anymore about redefines when using i.e.
                      my MySQL class together with the OCI8 class.

      (28-Mar-2009) - Added new methods "getConnectRetries()" and
                      "setConnectRetries()" which allows to change the number
                      of connect retries the class performs until it finally
                      gives up. This overrides the global define in dbdefs.inc.php
                      (OCIDB_CONNECT_RETRIES).

V0.77 (31-Dec-2008) - Next public release.

      (26-Dec-2008) - Added new method "ExecuteHash()". Now all methods which
                      have bindvariable support have their counterpart "*Hash()"
                      to pass bind variables as associative arrays.
                      Users are encouraged to use only the "*Hash()" functionality
                      when writing new code!

                    - Added three new examples: "test_general.php" dumps out all
                      defined methods inside the class, "test_dml.php" shows
                      how to use DML (INSERT/UPDATE) with the oci8 class and
                      "test_prep_execute.php" shows how to use "prepared" statements
                      with "Prepare()" and ExecuteHash()".

      (20-Dec-2008) - Fixed a very annoying bug when one tries to handle more
                      than one active query with the class. For whatever reason
                      I've stored always the internal statement handle whenever
                      one of the Query() methods was called, this overrides previous
                      values and could lead to unexpected results :( Now the class
                      checks if there is already a statement stored and only
                      saves the current statement handle if no other exists.
                      Query()/QueryHash() no longer set the internal statement
                      variable, so it is now safe to use multiple queries at once.

                    - Fixed some warnings when error_reporting is set to E_NOTICE.

V0.76 (11-Feb-2007) - First public release.

                    - Completed documentation, now the class is ready for
                      public release...finally...:|

                    - Added a missing return value for SaveBLOB(). Now it
                      returns 0 on successful completition.

                    - Added new example "test_inout_vars.php" which shows
                      how to use IN/OUT variables in PL/SQL procedures.

V0.75 (15-Dec-2006) - Added functionality to retry connection attempts in
                      case of an error - This is required here at work because
                      we have some network problems which result in connection
                      failures. See dbdefs.inc.php to define the retry counter.

V0.74 (02-Dec-2006) - Added new examples "test_desctable.php", "test_query.php",
                      "test_queryresult.php".

      (03-Nov-2006) - Added define OCIDB_MAIL_EXTRAARGS which allows to add
                      additional email header to the mail() command. Default
                      is nothing for this define.

                    - Removed method setErrorDisplay() as this is a double
                      method, use setErrorHandling() instead.

                    - Renamed method setConnectType() to setPConnect() as
                      this describes much better what exactly this method
                      is doing.

V0.73 (22-Aug-2006) - Added support for persistant connections. The class
                      provides one new method called "setConnectType()" and
                      also supports one new define from dbdefs.inc.php called
                      "OCIDB_USE_PCONNECT". If this define is set to 1 the
                      class always uses persistant, else normal connections.

V0.72 (30-Mar-2006) - Class constructor now supports passing of an alternate
                      config file, this allows to have multiple configuration
                      files when still using only one copy of the class.

V0.71 (28-Mar-2006) - QueryResultHash() now returns the $this->stmt handle,
                      as all other functions do. Reported by ANDL.

V0.70 (22-Mar-2006) - If RETURN_ALL_ERRORS is set and an error occures the
                      class still sends an email to the maintainer
                      (if configured). This is now fixed, emails are only
                      sent if RETURN_ALL_ERRORS is NOT set.

V0.69 (14-Feb-2006) - QueryHash() extended with support for full output hash
                      support. To supply your output hash a new method
                      "setOutputHash()" has been added and to clear up the
                      output hash (which is not done by the class!) another
                      method called "clearOutputHash()" has been added.

v0.68 (26-Jan-2006) - Added timing for all Oracle operations.
                      Use GetQueryTime() to return the time required.

V0.67 (16-Jan-2006) - PrintError() and other dump functions now support both
                      associative and numeric arrays. Also fixed some error
                      messages.

V0.66 (11-Jan-2006) - Print_Error() now detects if the class is running
                      under CLI sapi, in this case no HTML code is used for
                      formatting the error messages.

V0.65 (07-Jan-2006) - QueryResultHash() now prints the SQL query when DEBUG
                      mode is active and the Query counter is now also
                      correctly incremented.

V0.64 (01-Dec-2005) - Added new configuration parameter OCIDB_SENTMAILONERROR
                      as flag indicating if in case of an error a error
                      message should be sent to defined email address.
                      Set to 1 to enable this. If not given or set to 0 no
                      email is generated.

V0.63 (29-Nov-2005) - QueryHash() had a wrong function definition, the
                      reference '&' was missing for the supplied hash array
                      which results in no data being returned ARGH!

V0.62 (18-Aug-2005) - Added function QueryHash(), now both QueryResult()
                      and Query() have their counterpart with assoc. array
                      support.

                    - Added new define "OCIDB_ADMINEMAIL" which allows to set
                      an email address to be shown in error messages. If not
                      set the SERVER_ADMIN address is used.

V0.61 (10-Jul-2005) - Method "DescTable()" now increments internal query
                      counter, too.

                    - Added additional define "DB_SET_NUMERIC", only if this
                      is set to a value of 1 the DB_NUM_DECIMAL and
                      DB_NUM_GROUPING characters are set. If define is not
                      set or 0 these characters won't be set.

                    - DB_REGISTER is no longer mandatory, if not set the
                      class simply does no register anymore instead of
                      exiting.

                    - Renamed function "QueryInOutHash" to "QueryResultHash"
                      This was hopefully the last major change before the
                      class can be released to the public.

V0.60 (13-Jun-2005) - Fixed some debug output problems

V0.59 (08-Jun-2005) - Renamed defines DB_HOST,DB_USER,DB_PASS and APPNAME to
                      OCIDB_HOST,OCIDB_USER,OCIDB_PASS and OCIAPPNAME to
                      avoid name clashes with my MySQL class when both are
                      used in parallel.

                    - Fixed various bugs when errors are encountered during
                      wrong configured dbdefs.inc.php file.

      (01-Jun-2005) - Print_Error() calls $this->Rollback() before
                      disconnecting from Database. This provides a consistent
                      behavour in error conditions.

V0.58 (27-Apr-2005) - Added new method setPrefetch() which allows to control
                      the number of rows to prefetch. Calls OCISetPrefetch()

V0.57 (18-Apr-2005) - Fine-tuned the error handling, it is now possible
                      to degrade the level of information shown to the user
                      in case of an error.

V0.56 (11-Apr-2005) - Added support for phpDocumentor and CVS
